I found new job
So, finally I found my first job as a programmer in <a href="http://www.magion.cz">Magion</a> company
<p>I was ill for three weeks with fever which negatively affected my project's development, my effort to find a job and web pages updating. And I got also really lazy too... ;-)</p>
<p>As a small positive issue I can mention new translation of english subtitles to czech language for 5 episodes of Onegai Twins anime series with cooperation with <a href="http://preklad.otakuland.cz">InTranGroup</a>. I also spare two days for building my &quot;first&quot; AMV, but even this attempt doesn't show much promises.</p>
<p>I visit Brno to turn out of my private room there. Well, and about my first day in the work I mostly studied manuals as I had no computer available, which can cause problems for programming efforts... I hope better for tommorow.</p>
